Adjust the login/ logout to appear in the same place, a fized spot on the far right of the nav bar
Refactor the product line into a forEach so it will display any number of items
Refactor the nav bar to be floating at the top rather than fixed in the top/middle
Refactor the pages so there is less travel between pages with very little on them
Add links to the businesses' social media in a partial footer
